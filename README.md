# House-Price-Prediction

## Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features. By leveraging historical data on house sales, the model identifies patterns and relationships between different factors and the final sale price, enabling accurate price predictions for new data.

## Features

Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the processed training data.

Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using test data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the sale prices of houses based on input features.

## Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries and Frameworks:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
